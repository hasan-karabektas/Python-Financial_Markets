# Python-Financial_Markets
This project automatically generates a daily financial markets performance report for major global indices and distributes it via email. The script retrieves the latest constituent lists for the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, DAX and Euronext 100, fetches historical and live price data using yfinance, computes performance metrics (percentage versus previous close, one week ago, one month ago and one year ago), identifies the top and worst performers for each index, generates a structured HTML report and sends the final output via SMTP email. The architecture is modular (index list modules for fetching updated tickers, a real-time evolution engine for performance calculations, an HTML builder for table formatting and an email dispatcher for distribution), which makes it easy to extend the system to additional indices. The project is built with Python 3, pandas, yfinance and smtplib, and can be automated via GitHub Actions. To use it, simply run the main reporting script, which builds the index performance tables, generates the HTML report and sends it to the configured recipients. Note that excessive API calls may trigger Yahoo Finance rate limits, so caching static metadata such as sector, industry and company name is recommended to improve reliability and performance.
